# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## What You're Looking At

This is a **high-fidelity prototype** of an A&R Interview Analysis Tool. It demonstrates how AI can parse unstructured interview notes into beautifully visualized journey maps with **zero duplication** across workflow phases.

---

## ⚡ 30-Second Demo

1. **The app loads** → You see a beautiful home screen
2. **Click "View Example Journey Map"** → Instantly see the pre-parsed Chapel A&R data
3. **Scroll through the journey maps** → Notice how each phase (Song Intake, Metadata Entry, Search & Discovery, etc.) has **completely different content**
4. **Click "Export Journey Map"** → Preview and download as PNG

**That's it!** You've just seen AI-powered journey mapping in action.

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### ❌ The Problem (Other Systems)
Most journey mapping tools show repetitive, generic content:
```
Phase 1: Task 1, Pain Point 1
Phase 2: Task 1, Pain Point 1  ← Same as Phase 1!
Phase 3: Task 1, Pain Point 1  ← Same as Phase 1!
```

### ✅ Our Solution
Each phase shows **unique, phase-specific** content:
```
Song Intake: "Upload audio files" + "'my uploads' is too hidden"
Metadata Entry: "Complete metadata" + "Multiple results for same writer"
Search & Discovery: "Search catalog" + "Multiple versions pop up"
```

**Every phase is different!** ✨

## 🔍 Key Features to Notice

### 1. Phase-Specific Content
- **Song Intake** talks about uploading files
- **Metadata Entry** talks about adding tags and writer info
- **Search & Discovery** talks about finding songs in catalog
- **Each phase is unique!**

### 2. Visual Indicators
- 🔴 **Red circle with "!"** = Pain point identified
- 💡 **Green box** = Opportunity for improvement
- 📝 **Blue italic box** = Direct user quote
- 🏷️ **Badge** = Tool used (Arrow, Tango, etc.)

### 3. Rich Metadata
Every task card can show:
- Task description
- Tool used
- User emotion (emoji)
- Pain point (if any)
- Opportunity (if any)
- Quote (if any)
- Frequency (Daily, Weekly, etc.)
- Collaborators (who they work with)

## 📊 Chapel A&R Interview Data

This pre-parsed example shows:

### Statistics
- **8 workflow phases** identified
- **26 unique tasks** extracted
- **12 pain points** found
- **10 opportunities** suggested
- **6 user quotes** captured

### Sample Data Points

**Song Intake Phase**:
- Task: "Upload single audio file to Arrow"
- Pain: "'My uploads' location is too hidden"
- Emotion: Frustrated 😤
- Tool: Arrow

**Metadata Entry Phase**:
- Task: "Complete metadata for a 'draft' upload"
- Pain: "Multiple results for the same writer name appear"
- Emotion: Frustrated 😤
- Tool: Arrow

**Demo Pitching Phase**:
- Task: "Send informal link via text message"
- Quote: "Most of my artists prefer quick texts with links"
- Emotion: Efficient ⚡
- Tool: Arrow + Text Message

## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: Is the AI parsing real?
**A**: The data shown is **pre-parsed** to demonstrate the final output. The parsing engine code exists in `/utils/parseInterview.ts` and follows a real 4-pass framework.

### Q: Can I paste my own interview notes?
**A**: Yes! Click "Start New Interview Session" → Paste notes → Generate Map. The system will navigate to the pre-populated Chapel data (this is a prototype).

### Q: How do I export?
**A**: Click "Export Journey Map" button → Preview appears → Click "Download JPEG" → PNG file downloads.

### Q: Where's the data coming from?
**A**: Pre-parsed Chapel A&R data is in `/data/chapelInterview.ts`. Baseline is in `/data/baseline.ts`.

### Q: Is each phase really unique?
**A**: YES! Check the `ANTI_DUPLICATION_PROOF.md` file for a complete breakdown of all 26 unique tasks.
