## ü§ñ AI Parsing Framework (Behind the Scenes)

The Chapel A&R data shown on Screen 2 was generated using this 4-pass framework:

### **Pass 1: Identify Phases**
Scanned interview notes for workflow phase keywords and identified:
- Song Intake (Audio Upload)
- Metadata Entry & Linking
- Discovery & Curation
- Pitching (Formal)
- Demo Pitching (Informal)
- Pitch Tracking
- Contact Management
- Proposed Solutions

### **Pass 2: Segment Notes**
Divided the notes into blocks corresponding to each phase, with surrounding context

### **Pass 3: Extract Data Per Phase**
For each phase block, extracted:
- **Tasks**: Specific actions (e.g., "Upload single audio file")
- **Tools**: Software used (e.g., "Arrow", "Tango", "Text Message")
- **Emotions**: User feelings (e.g., "Frustrated", "Efficient", "Confident")
- **Pain Points**: Problems and challenges
- **Opportunities**: Suggested improvements
- **Quotes**: Direct user statements
- **Collaborators**: Who they work with
- **Frequency**: How often (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)

### **Pass 4: Validate & Deduplicate**
Removed duplicate tasks and ensured each phase has UNIQUE content

---

## ‚úÖ Key Differentiators (Anti-Repetition Rules)

### ‚ùå What We DON'T Do:
- Copy the same generic tasks across all phases
- Show "Task 1", "Task 2" in every container
- Duplicate pain points across multiple phases
- Fabricate data not found in the notes

### ‚úÖ What We DO:
- Extract phase-specific content only
- Show unique tasks per workflow phase
- Map pain points to their relevant phase
- Leave fields blank if data isn't found in notes

## üìù Example: Song Intake vs. Metadata Entry

### Song Intake Phase (Blue) Contains:
- "Upload single audio file to Arrow"
- Pain: "'my uploads' location is too hidden"
- Opportunity: "Make upload destination more prominent"

### Metadata Entry Phase (Green) Contains:
- "Complete metadata for a 'draft' upload"  
- Pain: "Multiple results for same writer name"
- Opportunity: "Writer deduplication system"

**NO OVERLAP** - Each phase has its own distinct content extracted from different sections of the interview notes.
